A Hare having ridiculed the slow movements of a Tortoise, 
was challenged by the latter to run a race, 
a Fox to go to the goal and be the judge. </br></br>
They got off well together, the hare at the top of her speed, 
the Tortoise, who had no other intention than making his antagonist exert herself, </br></br>
going very leisurely. After sauntering along for some time he discovered the Hare by the wayside, 
apparently asleep, and seeing a chance to win pushed on as fast as he could, </br></br>
arriving at the goal hours afterward, suffering from extreme fatigue and claiming the victory.</br></br>

     "Not so," said the Fox; "the Hare was here long ago, and went back to cheer you on your way."
