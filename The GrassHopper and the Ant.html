One day in winter a hungry Grasshopper applied to an Ant for some of the food which they had stored.</br></br>

     "Why," said the Ant, "did you not store up some food for yourself, instead of singing all the time?"</br></br>

     "So I did," said the Grasshopper; "so I did; but you fellows broke in and carried it all away."</br>
