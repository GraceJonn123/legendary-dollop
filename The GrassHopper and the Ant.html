One day in winter a hungry Grasshopper applied to an Ant for some of the food which they had stored.

     "Why," said the Ant, "did you not store up some food for yourself, instead of singing all the time?"

     "So I did," said the Grasshopper; "so I did; but you fellows broke in and carried it all away."
