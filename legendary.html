    <h2>Why chicken peck the ground.</h2>
    <p class="chicken">
    The chicken was a very poor animal. She and her chicks suffered alot due to their poverty. One day as Chickens child was going to the market, everybody sneered at the sight of her because of how unkempt she looked.</br>
    She felt so frustrated so she decided to go back home. Unfortunately by the time she got home her eyes were flooded with tears.</br>
"Mother! Mother!" she cried.</br>
When she told her mother what had happened near the market, her mother was devastated. The little chick's feathers were overgrown. She went quickly to Hawk who was her dear friend and borrowed a razor.</br>
Hawk was hesitant about giving away her only razor so she made Chicken promise that if she didn't return it, Hawk would be eating Chicken's children anytime she saw them on the ground. Carelessly and without thought she accepted.</br>
