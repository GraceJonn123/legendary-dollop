<h3>The Devoted Widow</h3></br></br>

A widow weeping on her husband's grave was approached by an Engaging Gentleman who, in a respectful manner, assured her that he had long entertained for her the most tender feelings.</br>

     "Wretch!" cried the Widow. "Leave me this instant! Is this a time to talk to me of love?"</br>

     "I assure you, madam, that I had not intended to disclose my affection," the Engaging Gentleman humbly explained, "but the power of your beauty has overcome my discretion."</br>

     "You should see me when I have not been crying," said the Widow.
