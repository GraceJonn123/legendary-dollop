    <h2>Why chicken peck the ground.</h2>
    <p class="chicken">
    The chicken was a very poor animal. She and her chicks suffered alot due to their poverty. One day as checkens child was going to the market, everybody sneered at the sight of her because of how unkempt she looked.</br>
     She felt so frustrated so she decided to go back home. Unfortunately by the time she got home her eyes were flooded with tears.</br>
"Mother! Mother!" she cried.</br>
When she told her mother what had happened near the market, her mother was devastated. The little chick's feathers were overgrown. She went quickly to Hawk who was her dear friend and borrowed a razor.</br>
Hawk was hesitant about giving away her only razor so she made Chicken promise that if she didn't return it, Hawk would be eating Chicken's children anytime she saw them on the ground. Carelessly and without thought she accepted.</br>
After trimming her chicks she felt so proud of how they looked and went about the whole village telling people how good her children looked. When she got home she had already forgotten where she put the razor.</br>
Hawk dropped by and asked for her razor but chicken kept pecking the ground looking for the razor. That is why chicken still peck the ground to try and find the razor. That is also why Hawks still eat chicks.</br>
